# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**This is a personal open-source project.** We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private security advisory feature:

**➡️ [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/walter75-Consulting/Business-Central-Apps/security/advisories/new)**

Please include as much information as possible:
- The affected app(s) and version(s)
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

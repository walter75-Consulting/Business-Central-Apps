# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - WordPress Plugin Moved

**This WordPress plugin has been moved to a dedicated repository.**

## 🔗 New Location

**[walter75-Consulting/WP-Plugins](https://github.com/walter75-Consulting/WP-Plugins)**

The WordPress plugin for displaying Business Central Extensions is now maintained in a separate repository for better organization and easier distribution.

## 📦 New Repository Structure

```
WP-Plugins/
└── walter75-bc-extensions/
    ├── walter75-github-integration.php
    ├── assets/
    ├── README.md
    ├── readme.txt
    └── EXAMPLES.md
```

## 🚀 Installation from New Location

```bash
cd /wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/walter75-Consulting/WP-Plugins.git
```

Or download directly from: https://github.com/walter75-Consulting/WP-Plugins

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Deprecated:** December 6, 2025
